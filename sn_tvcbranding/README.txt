SN TVC Branding
Project: Provide a means for the team to control the branding / skinning of their TV Companion, an externally hosted application

User Interface:
- Long, text-driven form: broke up pieces using field sets, based on themes and commonalities. 

What/How/When:
- (PHP) Information input in the form has to be formatted to XML and FTP'd to a remote host.
- (Drupal) Extensive use of fieldsets, and states.
- (PHP, Drupal) Gathering, organizing, displaying data

Issues:
- (Drupal) Mass Relevance section had special rules that did not play well within Drupal confines.
