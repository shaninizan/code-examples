SN Audio
Project: Re-write audio module to allow for iTunes syndication. This module was originally built by a contractor developer at the end of his term. It was written to play a single audio file within a pane. I expanded upon that functionality by adding many fields that are required by iTunes. Much of the CSS and JS are for rendering and playing the audio, which I did not build or change. I am including the supporting files, but listing the files with my contributions below:
 
 * sn_audio.features.field_base.inc
 * sn_audio.features.field_instance.inc
 * sn_audio.module
 * sn_audio.views_default.inc

What/How/When:
- (Drupal) Enhanced admin page
- (Drupal) Use of form states.
- (Drupal) Additional fields and subsequent validations.

Issues:
- Retrofitting code.
