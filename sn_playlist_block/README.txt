SN Playlist Block
Project: Take a custom video playlist block that had been built for one client and expand it to work for all clients

Interface Design
- Original requirement would allow the user to enter dimensions for every part of the video player and playlist
- Defined three options for the size of the video player (small, medium, large)
- Designed and illustrated five layout options. 
- Incorporated the items above into layout examples for the user to select

Scaling
- Limited size options to make styling manageable
- Expand to allow either taxonomy-based (automatic) or curated (manual) blocks
- Overhaul user interface
- Accommodate 30 sites' custom themes

Business Analysis
- Insure original client was not negatively impacted
- Defined 24 unique use cases before including checkbox options, this shaped the testing
- Organized roll-out


Note: This code was part of our Drupal 6 sites. The automatic generation of playlists had been expanded, and further expanded in our Drupal 7 sites.
