# Shani Brown - Angular Routing

The focus of this project was to create routes, validate input and pass data. In the first route, there was an input for a number with an abbreviation, and the second route displays the number with all its glorious places.

For my solution, I chose to send the original input as a query parameter to the second route where it got parsed then processed in a switch statement.

Also involved:
- Unit tests
- RegEx
- Error handling
