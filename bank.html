            naming convention: 
              - "account" is the key to identify the click event as a valid target
              - second spot is for the account type, in this case "checking", later it's "retirement". This could easily scale to add "savings", "credit", "moneymarket" etc
              - third part is the index. This will allow for multiple checking accounts, such as a personal and business. From a design standpoint, a custom name for each account would be managed on the back end, with that value displayed in the <h2> above this comment
              - Each piece is separated by an underscore so it's easily split in the javascript.
