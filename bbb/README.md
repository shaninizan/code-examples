# JavaScript BANK Project Description:
This is a front end only online banking application.  
The problem is that this application is poorly written, and is in desperate need of a refactor.
The existing code already satisfies the following requirements:
- A user can deposit money into one of the bank accounts.
- A user can withdraw money from one of the bank accounts.
- The balance in an account can't go negative. If a user tries to withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction.
- When the balance of the bank account is $0 the background of that bank account should be red. It should be gray when there is money in the account.
- The retirement account has an added feature: Every time you deposit money into this account, your employer adds an additional $10 to your balance with each deposit (what a nice employer!).  

# Your Job:
1) Refactor the code so that it is:
- Object-oriented (as opposed to procedural)
- DRY
- Follows good naming conventions
2) Comment the code to explain what it does and why you made certain design decisions.
3) Consider maintainability and reusability when refactoring.  
For example, think about how you could refactor the code so that adding an additional account to the page in the future would be as painless as possible.
4) Remove jQuery - only use vanilla JS.
**Bonus:** Use the retirement account to demonstrate inheritance
