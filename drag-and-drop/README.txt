Drag and Drop
Project: Provide two means of moving items from one column to another. One is using a drag-and-drop, the other using checkboxes and buttons.

Interface development:
- Designed a two-column interface with multiple options on right / receiving side.
- Incorporated checkboxes to allow for multi-select, and for clicking behavior.
- Included arrow buttons between the lists of options.
- Utilized built-in modals for error reporting, instead of plain JS alert().


What/How/When:
- Used HTML and CSS to create interface.
- Combined HTML5 and javascript for drag-and-drop functionality.
- Used Javascript to manipulate ids every time an item was moved.


Issues:
- ID consistency.
- Usability for different levels of users.
